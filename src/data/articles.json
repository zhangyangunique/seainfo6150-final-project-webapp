			"text": "In February 2002, when high school junior LeBron James came into the national consciousness and Sports Illustrated ran a cover story calling him “The Chosen One,” what could any reasonable person imagine? Another young athletic phenom, for one—with the potential to fall short of the hype. It had happened many times in sports before LeBron, and many times since: the can’t-miss sports teen who struck out. In fact, America’s premier athletic hype factory, ESPN, heaped even more expectations on James in his senior year, reserving coveted airtime for his high school games. Given the history of highly tipped athletes falling short, probably few would bet that he’d become the first player to lead three different teams to NBA titles, as LeBron did Sunday night when his Los Angeles Lakers steamrolled the Miami Heat 106-93 in the championship-clinching Game 6 of the NBA Finals. LeBron scored 28 points, grabbed 14 rebounds and dished out 10 assists. Can it now be argued that this athletic marvel from Akron, Ohio has a fair claim to dethroning Michael Jordan as the Greatest Of All-Time?",

			"text": "L’Equipe, the French sports newspaper, commemorated Maradona’s death, of a heart attack Wednesday at 60, with a headline on its cover: Dieu Est Mort. “God Is Dead.” At least a million people are expected to pay their respects in Buenos Aires Thursday as Maradona’s coffin lies in state at the Casa Rosada (“Pink House”) presidential palace. In Naples, where Maradona led Napoli to Italian league championships in 1987 and 1990, thousands of people congregated in streets and in front of the Stadio San Paolo to sing, swap stories and mourn. Maradona hailed from a shantytown on the outskirts of Buenos Aires and made his professional debut with the club Argentinos Juniors when he was 15. The 1986 Argentina-England World Cup quarterfinal, the game in which Maradona certified his legend, carried particular significance for Argentina following the 1982 Falklands War. England prevailed in the military conflict with Argentina over sovereignty of the archipelago some 300 miles off of Argentina’s southern coast. Despite his imperfections, Maradona will be mourned the world over. Champions League games had moments of silence: one coach recommended that Maradona’s number 10 be retired throughout world soccer. The Vatican announced that Pope Francis was keeping Maradona in his prayers.",

			"shortText": "The official cost of putting on the Tokyo Olympics is $12.6 billion",
			"text": "TOKYO — The cost of the one-year postponement of the Tokyo Olympics is estimated to be just under $2 billion, or about 200 billion yen. Japan’s Kyodo news agency and the Yomiuri newspaper both reported the figure on Sunday citing unnamed sources close to games organizers. The reported cost of the delay because of the COVID-19 pandemic is in line with repeated estimates over the last several months. The organizers, the Tokyo metro government and the Japanese national government are expected to report next month how the costs will be shared. The International Olympic Committee has said it would chip in about $650 million to cover some of the costs of the delay, but has offered few public details. Tokyo is becoming very expensive. The official cost of putting on the Tokyo Olympics is $12.6 billion. However, a government audit last year said it was probably twice that much. All but $5.6 billion is public money. Tokyo said the games would cost $7.3 billion when it won the bid in 2013. The $2 billion only adds to the total. A University of Oxford study published early this year — calculated before the postponement — said Tokyo was the most expensive Summer Olympics on record and the meter is still running. The IOC and organizers have been campaigning over the last several months to convince sponsors and a skeptical Japanese public that the Olympics can be held safely in the middle of a pandemic. The Olympics are to open on July 23, 2021, followed by the Paralympics on Aug. 24. They involve 15,400 athletes and ten of thousands of officials, judges, staff, VIPs, sponsors as well as media and broadcasters.",

			"text": "Normal. That’s a word for what so many of us long for as this incessant pandemic drags on, the end seemingly further away with every passing day. Yet, normal is nowhere to be found in the circus of Washington pandemic politics, of desperate economic crisis, and the surging threat of white supremacist violence. Nowhere, apparently, but college football. Because, despite the genuine concern initially offered this summer at the prospect of playing college football in the context of a global health crisis, somehow here we are, college football on the television and in the stadiums, and no one seemingly batting an eyelash. Yet, if you look closely, what you see is that universities are right now subjecting unpaid athletic workers to precisely the same health risks that are eliciting such outrage every day on network television and social media. The difference with college football? There is nary the commensurate concern. No one understands these developments better than the players who live them. One Power Five college football player, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, explained it this way: “I mean the whole goal is to make everyone feel like things are normal, which they definitely aren’t. Even as a player who’s living it, you have to remind yourself that this is in no way ‘normal’. What you’re seeing and hearing on TV isn’t the whole story. It’s a patchwork put together in order to resemble what we tell ourselves is what’s normal. It looks and feels good to watch football again, but it doesn’t mean everything occurring behind the scenes is being done right. Protocols are bulls–t. They just keep quiet, to those involved within the program or otherwise, and do everything within their power to get to the next Saturday.”",

			"text": "If someone told you to jump into an often tumultuous and always frigid North Atlantic Ocean from a 30-foot-high cliff in Ireland, would you do it?Turns out, not only are people doing it, tourists are increasingly paying for the privilege. I was one of them recently, and after jumping into the uncertain abyss, I came away with the undisputed highlight from a week-long trip to the fabled island -- not to mention newfound respect for the power of the sea.Colloquially known as coasteering and first invented in nearby Wales, the amphibious activity combines rough sea swimming, intertidal caving, cliff-climbing and leaping from extreme heights into the exposed sea below. Avoiding impact with rocks, hypothermia and drowning is all part of the fun.In truth, coasteering in Ireland is a lot safer, less extreme and more enjoyable than it sounds. For around $60 per person, local guides will typically fully outfit you with a warming wetsuit, safety helmet, protective gloves, water shoes, a mega life jacket and an exhilarating -- and probably exhausting (in a good way) -- itinerary.All told, it's a fantastic way to not only see the country's famous cliffs and shorelines in a new light, but to gain a new appreciation for an often-hostile environment.From County Cork in the southern peninsulas to the cliff coasts of Kerry, Clare and Galway in the middle, and then all the way up to County Donegal and Northern Ireland's timeless Giant's Causeway, nearly two dozen guiding companies provide coasteering tours around much of the island.",

A few moments later, it's soaring over the empty desert into a cloudless blue sky.This is the private runway at 1,100-acre Banasthali Vidyapith -- one of India's premier women's universities.Since its establishment in 1962, the university's School of Aviation has produced more than 5,000 alumnae, with dozens more in the pipeline.In a country where many people don't want to invest in girls, which is the mentality of most traditional families, Banasthali Vidyapith creates a place where women are equally important, Captain Tarana Saxena, a recent graduate, tells CNN Travel.They give girls a chance to learn about aviation ... a chance to fly.The inspiration for Banasthali Vidyapith University sprung from tragedy.Founder Hiralal Shastri, a politician who was born into a peasant family in Rajasthan, relocated to the village of Vanasthali in 1929 with his family.In this rural outpost, about 50 miles south of Jaipur, he founded a social program to reconstruct the village and educate local farmers.At a very young age, his daughter embraced his passion and began holding classes for village children.Tragically, she fell ill at the age of 12 and passed away.Encouraged by his wife, Shastri set out to educate and empower young women, a dream they had envisioned for their own daughter.And so Banasthali Vidyapith opened in 1935 with seven students -- all girls -- and now offers more than 28 disciplines, including doctoral degrees.",

			"text": "It doesn't look like much now — just a series of well-organized nails and a few fragments of rotted wood — but a Viking ship unearthed by archaeologists in Norway may have been the elaborate burial of a king, queen or powerful lord. According to BBC News, the ship was an impressive 62 feet (19 meters) long and 16 feet (5 m) wide. It was found at a site called Gjellestad, southeast of Oslo and dates to around A.D. 750-850, excavation archaeologist Knut Paasche of the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research, told the BBC. ‘We don't yet know if this was a rowing or sailing ship. Others, like the Gokstad and Tune ships, combined rowing and sailing,’ Paasche told the BBC, referring to two ninth-century Viking ships also found in Norway. The keel of the newfound ship looks different from either of those other Viking ships, he said. The ship was buried in a grave mound that had been flattened by decades of plowing by farmers. It sits within a large complex of at least 20 graves and is only a football field's length away from Jell Mound, the second-largest burial mound in Norway. Jell Mound dates back to between A.D. 400 and A.D. 500.",

			"text": "January 3, 1795 — When Josiah Wedgwood died on this day he left a thriving business and a fortune to his children. That’s because the pottery that he created was sought after across the world not only in palaces but also in humble homes. It was also because Wedgwood stood out as a potter of genius, a remarkable businessman and extraordinarily innovative salesman. Techniques often used today — direct mail, money-back guarantees, travelling salesmen, self-service, free delivery, buy one, get one free, illustrated catalogues — all came from Josiah Wedgwood. Born in 1730, he was the youngest of Mary and Thomas Wedgwood’s twelve children. Thomas was a potter, as had been members of the family since the 17th century. It was Josiah's great-grandfather who started the family pottery business in 1656. Early setbacks proved to be the making of Josiah. At the age of nine his father died and he had to abandon his formal school education to work in the family business. He soon became an expert operator of the potter’s wheel, but contracted smallpox which caused a knee infection. It meant he was unable to work the wheel’s foot pedal. Later in life the condition became so painful that Josiah had his right leg amputated just below the knee. At a time when there were no anaesthetics or even antiseptics, this was a brave decision by the budding entrepreneur, who obviously remained lame for the rest of his days. But his enforced physical inactivity had given him the time him to read, research, and experiment in the craft of pottery. As well as turning his attention to design, he set himself the task of producing a perfect glazed white body. Working tirelessly and refusing to be beaten, he finally succeeded after more than 400 experiments.",

It's been stored in the statue's pedestal ever since.But visitors will be able to see the original 3,600-pound torch in all its glory at a new Statue of Liberty Museum, which will open on Liberty Island in May 2019. The torch was transported there by truck last week, along with a replica model of Lady Liberty's face.Although it is not one of the most difficult things we have ever moved, says Douglas Phelps, who oversaw the relocation of the torch, it is certainly the most important.Not only is the Statue of Liberty the symbol of New York City, she is also a UNESCO World Heritage site under the designation of Outstanding Universal Value.Her full name is Liberty Enlightening the World, and she was designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel -- yes, the same guy who built Paris's Eiffel Tower.Lady Liberty was a gift from France to the United States to celebrate the centennial of their nation's independence -- although, somewhat awkwardly, she arrived a decade too late. Nevertheless, President Grover Cleveland formally unveiled her in 1886.Since then, the statue has served as a symbol of hope and possibility for many people who entered the United States as immigrants via neighboring Ellis Island.The original torch is a beautiful object of art and exemplifies the American ideals of freedom and democracy, says John Piltzecker, superintendent of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. That symbolic spirit was bolstered by the decision to inscribe Emma Lazarus' poem The New Colossus on the statue's pedestal, which gave Lady Liberty one of her nicknames, Mother of Exiles.The most famous lines in the poem are: Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.In 2017, nearly 4.5 million people visited Liberty Island.When completed, the Statue of Liberty Museum will be 26,000 square feet of history, inspiration and deeper analysis of the statue's symbolism both in the US and around the world.The inspiration gallery, which is where the torch will live, will have floor-to-ceiling glass windows looking out at Lower Manhattan, including the World Trade Center.",

			"text": "The Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy has slowly started defying its name, losing 4 centimeters of its tilt over the past 17 years.The movement, roughly 1.5 inches, comes after extensive consolidation work done between 1993 and 2001, which was required to reverse its slump and keep the tower upright.It means the building in Tuscany, which attracts thousands of tourists every day, is back to the tilt it had at the beginning of the 19th century, according to professor Salvatore Settis, who leads the surveillance group of the monument.The reduction of the tilt will not last forever -- but it's very significant and now we have good reasons to hope that the tower can last for at least another 200 years, Settis told CNN.When corrective work began on the tower it was leaning 6 degrees, or 13 feet, off the perpendicular on its south side. Soil was removed on the opposite side to reverse its trajectory.Technically it has been an incredibly complex work -- but the concept of the project is easy to understand, Settis said. The tower is leaning towards the South, so part of the soil under the northern side, basically sand and clay, was eliminated, creating cavities that the weight of the tower is now closing.",

			"text": "If someone told you to jump into an often tumultuous and always frigid North Atlantic Ocean from a 30-foot-high cliff in Ireland, would you do it?Turns out, not only are people doing it, tourists are increasingly paying for the privilege. I was one of them recently, and after jumping into the uncertain abyss, I came away with the undisputed highlight from a week-long trip to the fabled island -- not to mention newfound respect for the power of the sea.Colloquially known as coasteering and first invented in nearby Wales, the amphibious activity combines rough sea swimming, intertidal caving, cliff-climbing and leaping from extreme heights into the exposed sea below. Avoiding impact with rocks, hypothermia and drowning is all part of the fun.In truth, coasteering in Ireland is a lot safer, less extreme and more enjoyable than it sounds. For around $60 per person, local guides will typically fully outfit you with a warming wetsuit, safety helmet, protective gloves, water shoes, a mega life jacket and an exhilarating -- and probably exhausting (in a good way) -- itinerary.All told, it's a fantastic way to not only see the country's famous cliffs and shorelines in a new light, but to gain a new appreciation for an often-hostile environment.From County Cork in the southern peninsulas to the cliff coasts of Kerry, Clare and Galway in the middle, and then all the way up to County Donegal and Northern Ireland's timeless Giant's Causeway, nearly two dozen guiding companies provide coasteering tours around much of the island.",

			"shortText": "Fruits of the sea, like fish and shellfish, are some of the best choices of lean protein available — as long as you don't fry them or drown them in butter!",
			"text": "Fish and shellfish are both great sources of lean protein. Protein helps fill you up and keep you feeling satisfied, which in turn aids your weight-loss goals by making you less likely to snack on high-calorie fallback foods between meals. Protein also helps keep blood-sugar levels steady, which improves mood and protects against type 2 diabetes. Some fish and shellfish are high in vitamins and minerals like selenium, vitamin B12, niacin, iron, and zinc. The selenium in seafood is an antioxidant that can help manage arthritis and maintain healthy skin, while vitamin B12 may help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and slow memory decline. Niacin is a B vitamin that may aid in cataract prevention. Iron-rich clams, oysters, and shrimp can help maintain healthy hair. The zinc in oysters and crab can also contribute to healthy hair and beautiful skin, while reducing the risk of macular degeneration. Some shellfish are high in dietary cholesterol and therefore should be eaten in moderation by individuals with elevated LDL-cholesterol levels (if you have high cholesterol, speak with your physician about how much you should be eating). Fish that is cured, smoked, canned, or pickled is typically high in sodium and should be avoided by people with high blood pressure. And if you suffer from migraines, be aware that these same fish varieties, which include anchovies, caviar, lox, pickled herring, and sardines, are also potential migraine triggers.",

			"text": "Meats like beef and pork are high in protein, but they can also contain a lot of saturated fat, so I recommend always choosing the leanest cuts of these meats. Protein can help you maintain a healthy weight, increase your lean muscle mass, and keep you feeling satisfied longer. In addition to being good sources of protein, meats like beef, pork, and ham contain other important nutrients, including iron, zinc, and the B vitamins — B6, B12, and niacin. Eating lean cuts of these protein-rich meats in place of their high-fat counterparts can help reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and help keep your blood sugars balanced, which may lower your risk of diabetes. Vitamins B6 and B12 may help improve memory. Vitamin B6 is also involved in creating dopamine, a mood neurotransmitter that may reduce PMS symptoms. Both niacin and zinc help protect against vision problems: Niacin guards against cataracts, while zinc helps prevent and treat macular degeneration. Zinc, vitamin B12, and iron promote healthy hair. Iron also contributes to nail strength. Note that if you have gout, red meat can increase the uric acid in your body and exacerbate the condition, so even lean cuts should be eaten in moderation. The riboflavin in lean beef may help guard against migraines, but aged beef and any cured, smoked, or canned beef or pork product can be a migraine trigger in individuals who are sensitive.",

A record 30.6 million passengers will travel on US airlines during the Thanksgiving holiday, up from an estimated 29 million passengers a year ago, according to a forecast by Airlines for America, an US airline trade organization. The forecast translates to an estimated 2.55 million passengers per day, up 137,000 per day from a year ago. The busiest flying day is projected to be Sunday, November 25, with an estimated 3.06 million passengers trying to get home. The second-busiest day will be Wednesday, November 21, with 2.93 million people flying the day before Thanksgiving. The airline association defines the Thanksgiving travel season as starting Friday, November 16, and extending through Tuesday, November 27. The best day to fly during that 12-day period? It's Thanksgiving Day, with just 1.73 million people flying on the actual holiday. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen about 2.6 million passengers and crew on the Wednesday before the holiday, 500,000 more people than a typical weekday. On November 25, the Sunday after Thanksgiving, the agency estimates more than 2.7 million travelers will be flying home. That's why TSA officials say they're adding more than 1,200 TSA officers and an additional 80 passenger screening canine teams over the holiday, which they define as November 16 through November 26. As Thanksgiving and the holiday travel seasons arrive, ensuring the safety and security of the millions of passengers traveling daily remains TSA's top priority, said TSA Administrator David Pekoske, in a statement. We marked several records over the spring and summer travel periods this year, screening more than 525 million passengers and crew. This upcoming season will be very busy as more passengers choose to fly, and TSA officers will be on duty over the holidays so travelers can enjoy theirs.",

			"text": "Amid the farm houses and barns dotting the Mad River Valley area of rural Vermont, five miles north of Sugarbush ski resort, Marisa Mauro is making butter.About 700 pounds of it every week.While she and her assistant pack up golden bricks of butter, they can stare out at panoramic views of lush green hills that go technicolor red and yellow in autumn and sparkly white in winter.But there's no daydreaming here. Her business, Ploughgate Creamery at Bragg Farm, is booming, and her butter sells for $16 to $20 per pound to specialty shops, co-ops and Whole Foods grocery stores around the country.I'd say the biggest difference with our butter is that it's handmade, and our hands are on every step of the process, said Mauro, 33. Two girls are cranking out a lot of butter.Mauro's butter is rich and fatty, fresh but nutty, and it has a grassy tang that comes straight from the cows who made the cream. Those cows live just 30 miles down the road at Monument Farms. (Visit them to get fresh coffee milk, a New England original that adds sweet coffee flavor to cold milk.)Mauro packs some of the butter without salt and mixes large sea salt crystals into the rest, selling it as a salted variety with little flakes of texture and even more flavor.",

			"text": "If someone told you to jump into an often tumultuous and always frigid North Atlantic Ocean from a 30-foot-high cliff in Ireland, would you do it?Turns out, not only are people doing it, tourists are increasingly paying for the privilege. I was one of them recently, and after jumping into the uncertain abyss, I came away with the undisputed highlight from a week-long trip to the fabled island -- not to mention newfound respect for the power of the sea.Colloquially known as coasteering and first invented in nearby Wales, the amphibious activity combines rough sea swimming, intertidal caving, cliff-climbing and leaping from extreme heights into the exposed sea below. Avoiding impact with rocks, hypothermia and drowning is all part of the fun.In truth, coasteering in Ireland is a lot safer, less extreme and more enjoyable than it sounds. For around $60 per person, local guides will typically fully outfit you with a warming wetsuit, safety helmet, protective gloves, water shoes, a mega life jacket and an exhilarating -- and probably exhausting (in a good way) -- itinerary.All told, it's a fantastic way to not only see the country's famous cliffs and shorelines in a new light, but to gain a new appreciation for an often-hostile environment.From County Cork in the southern peninsulas to the cliff coasts of Kerry, Clare and Galway in the middle, and then all the way up to County Donegal and Northern Ireland's timeless Giant's Causeway, nearly two dozen guiding companies provide coasteering tours around much of the island.",

This pattern can also make driving treacherous across the Appalachians. An icy wintry mix is possible for the mountains Saturday, from the Carolinas to Pennsylvania.</li><li>NORTHEAST: Precipitation, mostly in the form of rain, will affect the region, leading to some moderate delays at the major airports and compounding delays already seen across the South.</li><li>MIDSECTION: Rain remains, with snow in the upper, upper Midwest (almost Canada).</li><li>WEST: Snow lingers in the Rockies, with leftovers for a little après-ski. There are also some showers still in Northern California, but most of the West Coast just stays cloudy with less precipitation.</li></ul>",

			"text": "Hello Kitty is one of Japan's most popular -- and definitely most adorable -- exports.Now, fans of the character can take their appreciation one step further by staying at a Hello Kitty-themed cottage at a glamping resort in Japan.The Grand Chariot Hokutoshichisei, an upscale resort with 23 individual cabins, called cocoons, has converted one of the cabins into an homage to the pink-bowed character, complete with wall art, bedspreads, a mirror and even bath salts bearing Hello Kitty's likeness.The property is on Japan's Awaji Island in Hyogo Prefecture. The island, which is about 70 km (43 miles) from Kobe, is particularly renowned for its wonderful stargazing -- fitting, then, that the cabin has been dubbed Hello Kitty Star's Cocoon.It has two beds and can hold from two to four people.The hotel falls along the 135th longitude line, which many believe has healing and restorative properties. To fit with that, the Grand Chariot has cedar soaking bathtubs known as hinoki in each cabin, as well as skylights for optimal stargazing without going outside.People who love cute characters and travel won't hurt for other Hello Kitty options when they're planning a vacation.",

			"text": "If someone told you to jump into an often tumultuous and always frigid North Atlantic Ocean from a 30-foot-high cliff in Ireland, would you do it?Turns out, not only are people doing it, tourists are increasingly paying for the privilege. I was one of them recently, and after jumping into the uncertain abyss, I came away with the undisputed highlight from a week-long trip to the fabled island -- not to mention newfound respect for the power of the sea.Colloquially known as coasteering and first invented in nearby Wales, the amphibious activity combines rough sea swimming, intertidal caving, cliff-climbing and leaping from extreme heights into the exposed sea below. Avoiding impact with rocks, hypothermia and drowning is all part of the fun.In truth, coasteering in Ireland is a lot safer, less extreme and more enjoyable than it sounds. For around $60 per person, local guides will typically fully outfit you with a warming wetsuit, safety helmet, protective gloves, water shoes, a mega life jacket and an exhilarating -- and probably exhausting (in a good way) -- itinerary.All told, it's a fantastic way to not only see the country's famous cliffs and shorelines in a new light, but to gain a new appreciation for an often-hostile environment.From County Cork in the southern peninsulas to the cliff coasts of Kerry, Clare and Galway in the middle, and then all the way up to County Donegal and Northern Ireland's timeless Giant's Causeway, nearly two dozen guiding companies provide coasteering tours around much of the island.",

They should though.While the landscape in England lacks the drama of other parts of the world -- and even other parts of the United Kingdom -- it makes up for it with a gentle, ancient beauty that's hard to match.London is widely acknowledged as a world-beating destination, but often overlooked beyond the capital is an incredible array of beautiful coastlines, rolling hills, quaint villages, historic cities and innovative design.It's something to remember on April 23 -- St. George's Day -- which is the closest thing England has to a national day. The day commemorates the death of England's patron saint, a legendary dragon slayer who wasn't actually from England.",
