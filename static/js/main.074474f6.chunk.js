It was Josiah's great-grandfather who started the family pottery business in 1656. Early setbacks proved to be the making of Josiah.

Later in life the condition became so painful that Josiah had his right leg amputated just below the knee. At a time when there were no anaesthetics or even antiseptics, this was a brave decision by the budding entrepreneur, who obviously remained lame for the rest of his days. But his enforced physical inactivity had given him the time him to read, research, and experiment in the craft of pottery.

A record 30.6 million passengers will travel on US airlines during the Thanksgiving holiday, up from an estimated 29 million passengers a year ago, according to a forecast by Airlines for America, an US airline trade organization. The forecast translates to an estimated 2.55 million passengers per day, up 137,000 per day from a year ago. The busiest flying day is projected to be Sunday, November 25, with an estimated 3.06 million passengers trying to get home. The second-busiest day will be Wednesday, November 21, with 2.93 million people flying the day before Thanksgiving.

It's Thanksgiving Day, with just 1.73 million people flying on the actual holiday. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen about 2.6 million passengers and crew on the Wednesday before the holiday, 500,000 more people than a typical weekday. On November 25, the Sunday after Thanksgiving, the agency estimates more than 2.7 million travelers will be flying home. That's why TSA officials say they're adding more than 1,200 TSA officers and an additional 80 passenger screening canine teams over the holiday, which they define as November 16 through November 26. As Thanksgiving and the holiday travel seasons arrive, ensuring the safety and security of the millions of passengers traveling daily remains TSA's top priority, said TSA Administrator David Pekoske, in a statement. We marked several records over the spring and summer travel periods this year, screening more than 525 million passengers and crew.
